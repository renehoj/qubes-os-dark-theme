# qubes-os-dark-theme
Nord theme designed to be used with Qubes OS

The theme has only been tested with XFCE dom0 and GNOME appvms.

dom0 theme matches appvm theme, making it look like a single uniform theme.

dom0 theme has thin colored border which matches the trust domain color.

appvm theme has accent colors that match the trust domain color, this needs to be set manually with the script.

Icons have been modified to remove the white background, but it has only done to the commonly used icons.
